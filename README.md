# Practice_shell

Some shell scripts written by myself.

* trash: I create the folder ~/.trash as the Recycle Bin in linux.And I use this script to manage the Recycle Bin.
* touchpad: Turn on or turn off the notebook's touchpad.
* note: Note something on ~/.note/notefile. (I have tried other note scripts but feels too heavy, so I write this script.)
